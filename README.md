# PM2.5-Monitor
A robot which is based on Arduino can automatically monitor the PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 in the air. It is also able to automatically upload the data to the cloud. The cloud I use in this robot is Lewei, and the website of it is www.lewei50.com. I used Wido Arduino, which is based on Arduino Leonardo, PM2.5 monitor, IO shield, and an IIC LCD 1602 display module in this robot.
